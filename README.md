## FAQ

### but Kindles supports .epub

No, they don't, and it's quite misleading marketing from Amazon to say that they do. **Kindles only support proprietary Amazon formats**.

When you send an .epub to your device using Amazon's app, your book is uploaded to their servers and converted to a format your Kindle can read before it's delivered to your device.

It is impossible to sideload .epubs offline by connecting to your Kindle over USB and copying the file over. 

### your code is a mess

thank you

### it's missing the ___ feature that Calibre has

Ignite does not aim to be feature complete with Calibre, but I'm very open to PRs that further expand Ignite's capabilities.
